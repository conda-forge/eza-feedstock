  description: |
    eza is a modern, maintained replacement for the venerable 
    file-listing command-line program ls that ships with Unix 
    and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and 
    better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file types 
    and metadata. It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. 
    And itâ€™s small, fast, and just one single binary.
