  description: |
    eza is a modern, maintained replacement for the venerable
    file-listing command-line program ls that ships with Unix
    and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and
    better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file types
    and metadata. It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git.
    And itâ€™s small, fast, and just one single binary.
